This project only has unit test and integration tests.

Integration test using an embedded HTTP server and publishes the web service to a specific URL

The client will then access the WSDL from that URL, get hold of the method stubs and invoke the service methods.

Ideally, the client would use the WSDL to generate all the artifacts (Java POJOs, XSDs etc) and then invoke methods on those objects 
with the web service deployed on a live glassfish server instead of using an embedded web server.
